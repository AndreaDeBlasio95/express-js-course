/** * |----- Middleware -----|
 * Middleware is a function that has access to the
 * request object (req),
 * the response object (res), and
 * the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
 * The middleware will be executed for every request made to the server
 * * The middleware needs to be placed before the route that you want to use it with

const exampleMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {

// Use the middleware
